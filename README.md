## Phalcon templates

Phalcon is a full-stack framework. It promotes the MVC architecture and offers features like an ORM, a Request object library, a templating engine, caching, pagination… a full list of features can be found on it’s [website](http://phalconphp.com/).

It really is very powerful and convenient framework. Phalcon is becoming increasingly popular among developers and I decided to share some of my experience.

## List of templates

Currently available templates. The list will be updated.
